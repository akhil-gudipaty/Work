README

I implemented this project using Python Flask and Sqlite. 

I implemented the index page using a helper function that checks whether the user has entered the right password. Based on that it would return a boolean and based on the boolean we display a message. 

To populate the entire data, I used the CSV reader and sequentially entered the data using insert statements. There is a function for this.
